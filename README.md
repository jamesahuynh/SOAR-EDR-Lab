# SOAR EDR Lab

## Objective
The SOAR EDR Lab aimed to integrate Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) with Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) by using tools such as Tines (SOAR) and LimaCharlie (EDR). Its purpose was to handle alerts from endpoint devices, orchestrate actions (such as isolating a machine via Slack or email notifications), and reduce manual SOC workload. The lab focused on creating automated playbooks for incidents like credential harvesting, with the goal of achieving faster, more consistent security operations and a stronger cybersecurity posture.

## Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) and Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), along with their practical applications
- Configuring detection rules, monitoring endpoint behavior, and collecting telemetry data using LimaCharlie
- Creating automated workflows (playbooks) for incident response
- Using Tines to trigger actions based on EDR alerts
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity

## Tools Used
- Tines as the Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) platform
- LimaCharlie as the Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solution
- Windows virtual machine with internet connectivity
